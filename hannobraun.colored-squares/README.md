# Colored Squares

## About

This is my entry for the [sixth montly #bbg game creation challenge](
https://github.com/hashbbg/bbgchallenge6), which ran from
15th May to 15th June 2012. During that timeframe each participant was allowed
to spend a total of 12 hours on his/her game, although I chose to submit my
entry after working only 6 hours on it. The randomly chosen genre was "Puzzle".

## How To Play

Play the game here: http://hannobraun.com/colored-squares/

Use the left, right and down arrow keys for control. Try to stack blocks of the
same color as high as possible.
